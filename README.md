This Databricks notebook is a demonstration of a data engineering ETL pipeline with some data analysis using Spark in Databricks.  

In it, we will:
- Gather raw NHL game data.
- Generate shot statistics for analyzing the effectiveness of distance and angle.
- Aggregate shot statistics data.
- Perform analysis of the aggregated data.
- Generate statistics related to a player's scoring influence on the team.
- Aggregate scoring statistics data.
- Perform analysis of aggregate data, adjusting for skewness.

This was originally developed as a Databricks Community edition notebook. A more legible published version with collapsible output cells can be viewed here:
